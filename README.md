 Repository of "[A county-level soybean yield prediction framework coupled with XGBoost and multidimensional feature engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103269)" and the paper of "Investigating how yield trends affect machine-learned crop yield predictions: Comparing detrending approaches using XGBoost" (under review). These two papers make up my graduation thesis.

"[A county-level soybean yield prediction framework coupled with XGBoost and multidimensional feature engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103269)" is my first paper mainly conducted some experimental work, including selection of predictor variables, machine model comparisons and explorations in feature engineering. So at that time, the code was experimental. Therefore, I used Jupyter Notebook to ensure that I could run and output the parts I wanted anytime, anywhere. Of course, the code is somewhat messy and dirty, please forgive me. The code can be categorized into two types: data preprocessing and model prediction. The code for the first paper is unavailable here (It has been improved and used for the second paper and my graduation thesis, and at that time, I was not proficient in using version control software). But The first ten rows of data from the soy input data can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Pinery-lee/Predicted-soybean-yields-by-XGBoost/tree/main/data/first_paper), showing what features (columns) were used and it only involves soybean yield data in the first data. The full soybean input data is available here: [all-data.csv in aliyundrive](https://www.aliyundrive.com/s/BWngaLBpLbL) or [all-data.csv in google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sN88IUqi8iH0fuI5kNcRyG_zR0UYQhuL/view?usp=sharing).

"Investigating how yield trends affect machine-learned crop yield predictions: Comparing detrending approaches using XGBoost" (under review) is the second paper, which specifically explores yield trends based on the first paper. The data in this paper involves both soybean and maize yields data. Many modifications have been made to the code, which can be found here. Additionally, you can access all the processed data here and here.
